There's still a lot to do. Below is a short-list of some stuff I'm currently either
working on or thinking about. If anything on that list gets to be in a particular version
it will move there.

- Export timer data to a CSV or Excel or any other format
- Backup data to either iCloud or any other cloud-based solution
- Widgets and/or LiveActivities
- A better "day view" so that you can more easily see if you're hitting your goals
- A "goals" screen/setting so that you may steer Decima to help you with making
your "ideal" day easier
