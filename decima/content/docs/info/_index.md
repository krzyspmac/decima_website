# Decima Manifesto

## What is it?

It's an iOS application that helps you track time expenditure broken down into tasks.
The ingenious idea behind it:
- *create* a timer
- *start* a timer when you commence an activity, say, a yoga session
- when done *stop* the timer and Decima will tell you how much time you've spent
- profit!

You can then track the time expenditure across days, months, years.

It has been designed to work with the Apple Watch in unison. Data is being synchronised
between an iPhone and an Apple Watch so you can start a timer on one and stop on the other.

Only one Apple Watch is supported at the moment sadly :/

## What it is not?

It's not a simple timer. It's best used when tracking multiple activities across a larger
span of time.

## Why would I want to use it?

If you want to time-box events, have more control over the time you're spending on specific
tasks then Decima may probably help with that.

Set *Alerts* for each timer so you're informed beforehand when approaching any
limits you may put on a specific activity.
