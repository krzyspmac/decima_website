So... moving from UIKit to SwiftUI proved to be a real bummer :)
There have been no updates for the app and I can only blame the sun and the universe for
my own short-comings ;)

But the application is not dead and 1.7 will see the light of day sometime before
September.

New stuff will include:
- a redesigned UI that includes a "browser list"
- some of the views redone in SwiftUI (there's no going back...)
- a bunch of internal changes that will allow me to include new features that have
been waiting in the queue for too long a time
