The ingenious idea behind it:\ncreate a timer start a timer when you commence an activity, say, a yoga session when done stop the timer and Decima will tell you how much time you\u0026rsquo;ve spent profit! You can then track the time expenditure across days, months, years.\nIt has been designed to work with the Apple Watch in unison. Data is being synchronised between an iPhone and an Apple Watch so you can start a timer on one and stop on the other.\nOnly one Apple Watch is supported at the moment sadly :/\nWhat it is not? # It\u0026rsquo;s not a simple timer. It\u0026rsquo;s best used when tracking multiple activities across a larger span of time.\nWhy would I want to use it? # If you want to time-box events, have more control over the time you\u0026rsquo;re spending on specific tasks then Decima may probably help with that.\nSet Alerts for each timer so you\u0026rsquo;re informed beforehand when approaching any limits you may put on a specific activity.\nFeature list # Create, start, stop and inspect individual timers and its entries Set Alerts so that you can inform yourself when time for a particular task is up Synchronisation with the companion Apple Watch App Modify individual timer entries; modification updates the timer on both: the iPhone and the Apple Watch "},{"id":5,"href":"/decima/docs/how-to/","title":"Knowledge base","section":"Docs","content":"A collection of short tutorials on how to get the best out of Decima.\n"}]
