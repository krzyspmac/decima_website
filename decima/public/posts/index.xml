      <description>So&amp;hellip; moving from UIKit to SwiftUI proved to be a real bummer :) There have been no updates for the app and I can only blame the sun and the universe for my own short-comings ;)
But the application is not dead and 1.7 will see the light of day sometime before September.
New stuff will include:
a redesigned UI that includes a &amp;ldquo;browser list&amp;rdquo; some of the views redone in SwiftUI (there&amp;rsquo;s no going back&amp;hellip;) a bunch of internal changes that will allow me to include new features that have been waiting in the queue for too long a time </description>
